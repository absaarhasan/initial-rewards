### Technical Challenge

Build a SPA application using ReactJS or AngularJS that allows the user to select a geometric shape and set the size of the shape. Upon clicking on the render button, the shape’s size will change accordingly.

- The shapes in the top part are clickable and will direct the user to the shape’s page
- To create the shapes, use canvas / css
- Every shape has it’s own features, which means the settings should be different (i.e., for the circle, we should be able to input the radius)
- The input is numeric, the “px” is a static postﬁx added to the input
- Make sure to validate the user’s input and display messages accordingly
- Design the page as you like, using any framework you choose, in order to make it user friendly & responsive
